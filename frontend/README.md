# Frontend

The frontend is a simple application implemented with the React framework. It retrieves weather data through the backend API and displays it in a simple table.

## Getting Started

Instructions on how to set up and run the frontend locally.

### Prerequisites

### Dev setup step-by-step

1. Create `.env` in project root. Add backend API address to the .env file.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start development environment: `npm start`
4. Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Connection to backend
